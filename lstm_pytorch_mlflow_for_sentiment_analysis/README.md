# Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch and MLFlow

This project demonstrates how to train a sentiment analysis model using PyTorch and track everything with MLFlow, including parameters, metrics, artifacts, and model signature.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for text and vocabulary
- Optional GloVe embedding integration
- LSTM-based classification model
- MLFlow logging (metrics, models, inputs, outputs)
- End-to-end reproducibility and local prediction script
